# 🌾 FarmHub

FarmHub is a Django-based farm management system with role-based access and integrated livestock & production management.
The system uses Django Admin for backend control and DRF APIs for frontend/mobile integration.
This project combines **Django (Admin & APIs)** and **FastAPI (Reporting APIs)** with **role-based permissions**.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone your repository inside it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahoraiar/FarmHub.git
```
### Step 2: Go inside the repo
```bash
cd FarmHub
```
### 4. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac[git bash]
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows[powershell]
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## 🚀 Run the Project

## Run Django 
```txt
Example: if your terminal looks like this: 
(venv) I:\FarmHub>
```
👉 First go inside the core folder:
```bash
cd core
```
👉 Then run the Django server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Run FastAPI (Reporting Service)
⚡ Important: You must open another terminal window/tab and also activate the virtual environment there.
```txt
Example: in the second terminal, if you are here:
(venv) I:\FarmHub>
```
👉 Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn reporting.main:app --port 5000 --reload
```

  - Agent → can only manage their Farmers  
  - Farmer → ❌ cannot create others  

- **Farmers (Admin UI)**:

## ✅ Permissions System

Permissions are enforced by **Django Groups + DRF Custom Permissions**:

| Role | Can Create | Can View | Can Update/Delete |
|------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **SuperUser** | SuperAdmin, Agent, Farmer | All | All |
| **SuperAdmin** | Agent, Farmer | Own + Agents | Own + Agents |
| **Agent** | Farmer | Own Farmers, Own Farms | Own only |
| **Farmer** | ❌ | Own farm & profile only | ❌ |

---

## 🔗 API + Admin Flow

1. **SuperUser** creates a `SuperAdmin` via `/registration/`  
2. **SuperAdmin** logs in → creates **Agents**  
3. **Agents** log in → create **Farms**  
4. **Agents/SuperAdmins** → create **Farmers** inside farms  
5. **Farmers** → only access their own farm data  

---

🌾 FarmHub Reporting API - README

FarmHub Reporting API is a FastAPI-based reporting service for livestock and farm management.
It works alongside the Django FarmHub system and provides reporting endpoints for farms, cows, cow activities, and milk production.
🔑 Authentication

FarmHub Reporting API uses JWT tokens for authentication.

1. Login to get Token

Endpoint: /auth/token
Method: POST
Payload:

{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}


Response:

{
  "access": "<JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
  "refresh": "<JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN>"
