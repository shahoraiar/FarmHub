# 🌾 FarmHub

FarmHub is a Django-based farm management system with role-based access and integrated livestock & production management.  
The system uses Django Admin for backend control and DRF APIs for frontend/mobile integration.  
This project combines **Django (Admin & APIs)** and **FastAPI (Reporting APIs)** with **role-based permissions**.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone your repository inside it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahoraiar/FarmHub.git
```
### Step 2: Go inside the repo
```bash
cd FarmHub
```
### Step 3: Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac[git bash]
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows[powershell]
```
### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## 🚀 Run the Project

### Run Django 
```
Example: if your terminal looks like this: 
(venv) I:\FarmHub>
```
👉 First go inside the core folder:
```bash
cd core
```
👉 Then run the Django server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Run FastAPI (Reporting Service)
⚡ **Important:** You must open another terminal window/tab and also activate the virtual environment there.
```txt
Example: in the second terminal, if you are here:
(venv) I:\FarmHub>
```
👉 Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn reporting.main:app --port 5000 --reload
```

## 🌱 Farms & Farmers

### Farmer (Role User)
- **Note:** To create a Farmer user, you must first create a Farm.  
- A Farmer must be assigned to a Farm, and a Farm can have many Farmers.

| URL | Method | Description | Permission |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `/farms/farmer/create/` | POST | Create a **Farmer user** + Farmer profile | SuperAdmin, Agent (with model perms) |
| `/farms/farmer/list/` | GET | List Farmers under your control | SuperAdmin (all via Agents) / Agent (own farmers) |

**Conditions**:
- When creating Farmer, must select a Farm.  
- Farm must belong to the logged-in Agent/SuperAdmin.  
- Created Farmer automatically gets a **User account** + assigned to `Farmer` group.  

---

### Farm
| URL | Method | Description | Permission |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `/farms/create/` | POST | Create a Farm | SuperAdmin, Agent (with model perms) |
| `/farms/list/` | GET | List Farms | SuperAdmin (sees farms of own agents), Agent (own farms), Farmer (only their assigned farm) |

**Conditions**:
- **SuperAdmin** → can assign farms to Agents created by them.  
- **Agent** → can only assign farms to themselves.  
- **Farmer** → only sees the farm assigned to them.  

---

## 🛠️ Django Admin Customizations

- **Users (Admin UI)**: 
  - SuperAdmin → can only create/manage **Agents** and their Farmers  
  - Agent → can only manage their Farmers  
  - Farmer → ❌ cannot create others  

- **Farmers (Admin UI)**:
  - SuperAdmin → can create Farmers for their Agents  
  - Agent → can create Farmers for themselves  
  - Farmer → ❌ cannot create  

- **Farms (Admin UI)**:
  - SuperAdmin → can create farms for their Agents  
  - Agent → can create farms for themselves  
  - Farmer → can only see their own farm  

---

## ✅ Permissions System

Permissions are enforced by **Django Groups + DRF Custom Permissions**:

| Role | Can Create | Can View | Can Update/Delete |
|------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **SuperUser** | SuperAdmin, Agent, Farmer | All | All |
| **SuperAdmin** | Agent, Farmer | Own + Agents | Own + Agents |
| **Agent** | Farmer | Own Farmers, Own Farms | Own only |
| **Farmer** | ❌ | Own farm & profile only | ❌ |

---

## 🔗 API + Admin Flow
### 📌 Step-by-step Flow

1. SuperUser (Django system user) is created with:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
→ Enter credentials (username, email, password).  
→ Login to /dashboard (Django Admin).

2. From the Admin UI, the SuperUser can create a SuperAdmin user.
3. SuperAdmin logs in and can create Agents.
4. Agents log in and create Farms.
5. Agents/SuperAdmins create Farmers inside Farms (each Farmer must belong to a Farm).
6. Farmers only access their own farm data.

### 📌 Creating a SuperAdmin via API
If you use the API, you don’t need to log in first.
You can directly call:  
POST
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/registration/
```
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword",
  "user_role": "SuperUser"
}
```
This will create a SuperAdmin account directly via API.

✅ Clear difference:

- Django Admin UI → create via createsuperuser + Dashboard login.
- API → send JSON to /registration/, no login needed first.

Create Agent
POST /api/v1/registration/ (with JWT of SuperAdmin)
```text
{
  "username": "agent1",
  "password": "1234",
  "user_role": "Agent"
}
```
Create Farm
POST api/v1/farms/create/ (with JWT of Agent/SuperAdmin)
```text
{
  "name": "Green Farm",
  "location": "Village X"
}
````
Create Farmer
POST api/v1/farms/farmer/create/ (with JWT of Agent/SuperAdmin)
```text
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "username": "farmer_john",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "1234",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "address": "Village Road",
  "farm": 1
}
```
Note:  
After successful creation, this user is automatically added to the Farmer Role group.

🌾 FarmHub Reporting API **(FastAPI)**

FarmHub Reporting API is a FastAPI-based reporting service for livestock and farm management.  
It works alongside the Django FarmHub system and provides reporting endpoints for farms, cows, cow activities, and milk production.

FarmHub Reporting API uses JWT tokens for authentication.

1. Login to get Token
Endpoint: /auth/token  
Method: POST  
Payload:  
```
{
  "username": "super1",
  "password": "12345678"
